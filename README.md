# Request101

#### Wizard101 request-based quiz solver for 100 daily crowns.

## Notes

0. This is an old project of mine and the code is messy. It is not indicative of my current work as an engineer.
1. If using FAST_CAPTCHA=true, you must also set a delay around 1000ms to avoid getting banned.

## Setup

> **How do I setup and use this thing?**
>
> 1. First, you must install NodeJS, which can be installed here (pick LTS):
>
>     > https://nodejs.org/en/download/
>
> 2. Next install Git from here:
>
>     > https://git-scm.com/downloads
>
> 3. Next, you need to open your terminal/command prompt. On windows press _Windows Key_ and then type `cmd` and click enter. On Mac open Terminal _(its pre-installed)_. Now type this:
>
>     > `git clone https://github.com/aarock1234/Request101`
>
> 4. After it has completed you must type this:
>
>     > `cd Request101`
>
> 5. Now you can open up the file explorer using the command `explorer .` on Windows and `open .` on a Mac _(don't forget the `.` after)_.
> 6. Now navigate to the user folder.
> 7. Be sure to have your CapSolver key ready as Wizard101 has plenty of captchas. Load a key here: https://dashboard.capsolver.com/dashboard/overview. CapSolver costs about $0.60 per every 1000 captchas solved. It takes 11 captchas per 100 crowns, aka $0.6 for 9000+ crowns.
> 8. Now you must navigate to the config folder and edit the _config.ts_ file. You can edit this with any standard text editor.
> 9. Now that everything is set up go back to your command prompt/terminal and type this:
>
>     > `npm install`
>
> 10. Now, wait for it to install completely.
> 11. Now you can type this command:
>     > `npm start`
>
> 🎉 DONE! 🥳 Only run this **ONCE** a day. Please report any issues in the issues tab.
