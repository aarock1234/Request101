## Setup

> **How do I setup and use this thing?**
> 
> 1. First, you must install NodeJS, which can be installed here (pick LTS):
>> https://nodejs.org/en/download/
>
> 2. Next install Git from here:
>> https://git-scm.com/downloads
>
> 3. Next, you need to open your terminal/command prompt. On windows press *Windows Key* and then type `cmd` and click enter. On Mac open Terminal *(its pre-installed)*. Now type this:
>> `git clone https://github.com/aarock1234/Request101`
>
> 4. After it has completed you must type this:
>> `cd Request101`
>
> 5. Now you can open up the file explorer using the command `explorer .` on Windows and `open .` on a Mac *(don't forget the `.` after)*.
> 6. Now navigate to the user folder.
> 7. Be sure to have your CapSolver key ready as Wizard101 has plenty of captchas. Load a key here: https://dashboard.capsolver.com/dashboard/overview. CapSolver costs about $0.60 per every 1000 captchas solved. It takes 11 captchas per 100 crowns, aka $0.6 for 9000+ crowns.
> 8. Now you must navigate to the config folder and edit the *config.ts* file. You can edit this with any standard text editor. 
> 9. Now that everything is set up go back to your command prompt/terminal and type this:
>> `npm install`
>
> 10. Now, wait for it to install completely.
> 11. Now you can type this command:
>> `npm start`
>
